# Story 1.1: Database Adapter Architecture Enhancement

## Status
**Approved**

## Story
**As a** developer working with multiple database types,
**I want** LazyTables to support a unified adapter interface for different databases,
**so that** I can seamlessly switch between PostgreSQL and MySQL connections using familiar LazyTables workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Enhanced adapter trait supports database-specific capabilities while maintaining unified interface
2. MySQL and MariaDB adapters implement full connection, query, and metadata operations
3. Database type detection and appropriate adapter selection works automatically
4. Connection pooling supports multiple database types simultaneously
5. Error handling provides database-specific error messages and recovery suggestions

### Integration Verification

- **IV1**: All existing PostgreSQL connections continue to work exactly as before with no configuration changes required
- **IV2**: Existing six-pane navigation and vim keybindings remain unchanged for PostgreSQL workflows
- **IV3**: PostgreSQL query execution performance maintains current benchmark levels (sub-50ms for simple queries)

  - [ ] Implement adapter switching logic in connection manager
  - [ ] Add database type validation during connection creation

  - [ ] Write unit tests for database type detection
  - [ ] Write unit tests for connection pooling functionality
  - [ ] Write integration tests for adapter switching

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories - this is the first story in the epic.

### Data Models
**Source: Current codebase analysis - src/database/mod.rs**
- `DatabaseType` enum supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, Oracle, Redis, MongoDB
- `ConnectionConfig` struct handles database configuration with encrypted password support
- `ConnectionStatus` enum tracks connection states (Disconnected, Connecting, Connected, Error)
- `DataType` enum supports common SQL types with database-agnostic representation
- `TableColumn` and `TableMetadata` structs for database schema information

### Connection Interface Specifications
**Source: Current codebase analysis - src/database/connection.rs**
- `Connection` trait currently supports: `connect()`, `connect_with_key()`, `disconnect()`, `is_connected()`, `config()`
- Trait is async and requires Send + Sync
- Missing: query execution, metadata operations, database-specific capabilities
- Current MySQL implementation exists but incomplete (lacks query execution and metadata)

### Component Specifications
**Source: Current codebase analysis - src/database/**
- Database modules organized as: mod.rs, connection.rs, postgres.rs, mysql.rs, sqlite.rs
- Each database adapter implements Connection trait
- Connection pooling uses sqlx::Pool for each database type
- Error handling through custom LazyTablesError types

### File Locations
**Source: Current project structure analysis**
- Database adapters: `src/database/` directory
- Connection trait: `src/database/connection.rs`
- MySQL implementation: `src/database/mysql.rs` (existing, needs enhancement)
- PostgreSQL implementation: `src/database/postgres.rs` (existing, working)
- Main database module: `src/database/mod.rs`

### Testing Requirements
**Source: CLAUDE.md development notes**
- Unit tests for all core modules required
- Integration tests for database adapters
- Performance benchmarks for large datasets
- Test location: Standard Rust test files alongside source code
- Testing framework: Standard Rust test framework with async support

### Technical Constraints
**Source: CLAUDE.md and current codebase**
- Use async/await patterns for database operations
- Maintain existing PostgreSQL functionality (backward compatibility)
- Follow Rust best practices with proper error handling
- Use sqlx for database connectivity (already established pattern)
- Preserve vim-style navigation and six-pane layout (no UI changes)
- Performance requirement: sub-50ms for simple queries

### Project Structure Notes
Current structure aligns with planned architecture. Database adapters are properly organized in `src/database/` with clear separation between database types. The Connection trait provides the interface contract that needs enhancement.

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**Based on development notes and current codebase patterns:**

- **Test file location**: Tests alongside source files using Rust's built-in test framework
- **Test standards**: Unit tests for each public method, integration tests for database connections
- **Testing frameworks**: Rust standard test framework with tokio for async testing
- **Specific requirements**:
  - Test all database types separately
  - Test adapter selection logic
  - Test connection pooling under load
  - Test error handling scenarios
  - Test backward compatibility with existing PostgreSQL connections
