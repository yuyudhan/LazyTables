# LazyTables

**"Because life's too short for clicking around in database GUIs"**

A fast, terminal-based SQL database viewer and editor designed for developers who value keyboard-driven workflows. Built with Rust and featuring vim motions throughout, LazyTables provides an intuitive interface for database management without ever leaving your terminal.

## Why LazyTables?
