So there is something called cargo binstall. This installs the prebuilt binaries. Somehow my application is not supporting that. How to make it support that?

In the SQL Editor we have VIM modes active. In that VIM mode I want you to implement pressing X in normal mode to delete the character under cursor.

=======================================
DONE:
This is for the SQL query editor pane. Can you implement pressing O to insert new line and going into edit mode pressing shift O to create a line above and going to insert mode pressing capital A to go at the end of the line pressing capital I to start editing from the below beginning of the line. These are the standard vim motions.

=======================================
When the user presses y they should copy the cell value which is under the cursor and when the user presses double yy they should copy the entire row into the clipboard.
=======================================
=======================================
=======================================
I am seeing a strange behavior when I am in the SQL query editor. When I press Q and then press Y, it does not quit. But when I press Q and press Y, the application gets quit correctly. I don't know why this is happening. Can you find out the issue and resolve it? This is happening when I am in insert mode and then I go into normal mode. This happens only when I come back to normal mode after going into insert mode. What might be the issue?

=======================================
We need the theming to be moved to this directory. ~/.config/lazytables/theme.yaml or theme.yml file. This helps Users build custom themes. The theming structure of the platform, sorry not the platform, the TUI application list tables should be minimal and not too overwhelming for our users. Find out what is needed, how it is needed and how we can structure it within the TUI app lazy tables as well as how we can make it usable and more user friendly as well.

In the connection creation and connection edit modal. This is the feature I want you to implement.
  üîÑ Connection String Mode Preservation

  // TODO: Detect if connection was created via connection
  string and restore that mode
  if connection.was_created_from_connection_string {
      modal_state.using_connection_string = true;
      modal_state.connection_string =
  connection.to_connection_string();
  }

=======================================
  üîç Connection Validation on Edit

  - Live validation: Show real-time feedback as user modifies
  connection details
  - Changed field indicators: Highlight which fields have been
   modified
  - Revert option: Allow user to reset individual fields to
  original values
=======================================
In the connection creation and connection edit modal. This is the feature I want you to implement.
  - Modal sizing: Better responsive modal sizing for different
   terminal sizes
  - Field focus management: Improve tab navigation and field
  focus indicators
=======================================
In the connection creation and connection edit modal. This is the feature I want you to implement.
  - Field validation styling: Red borders for invalid fields,
  green for valid
=======================================
=======================================
=======================================

=======================================

=======================================
Instead of showing the buttons in the connection creation and connection edit pane, sorry not pane, I mean modal. Can we just show what keystrokes to press instead, like C for cancel, S for save, T for test.

=======================================
I GUESS THIS IS DONE:
I want you to complete the edit functionality modal in the connections pane so that all the connections can be properly edited. Just validate if any other tasks need to be done to make it completed.
