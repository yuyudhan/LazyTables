#  FilePath: .gitignore

# Purpose: This file specifies patterns for files and directories to be ignored by Git
# in the LazyTables Go project. It ensures that temporary, build, or sensitive files
# are excluded from version control, enhancing security, maintainability, and cleanliness.
#
# Key Functionalities:
# - Excludes build artifacts, dependency directories, and temporary files.
# - Protects sensitive data like logs, configs, and credentials from being committed.
# - Organizes patterns into logical sections for clarity and future extension.
#
# Considerations:
# - Patterns are designed for a Go project using standard tools (e.g., go mod, go build).
# - Ensures compatibility with development environments like Neovim and CI/CD pipelines.
#
# Maintenance Guidance:
# - Add new patterns under relevant sections as the project evolves (e.g., new tools, file types).
# - Review periodically to ensure no critical files are accidentally ignored.
# - Avoid overly broad patterns (e.g., '*') to prevent unintended exclusions.
