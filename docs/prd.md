# LazyTables Brownfield Enhancement PRD

## Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Existing Project Overview

**Analysis Source**: IDE-based fresh analysis from existing documentation in docs/dev/ and docs/user/

**Current Project State**:
LazyTables is a terminal-based SQL database viewer and editor built in Rust using Ratatui. It features a fixed six-pane layout optimized for database navigation with vim-style keyboard shortcuts. Currently supports PostgreSQL with planned expansion to MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and others. The application provides connection management, table browsing, SQL query editing with file management, and real-time query results display.

### Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**: ✅ New Feature Addition (Major features to be delivered)

**Enhancement Description**: Transform LazyTables into a comprehensive terminal-based SQL tool that rivals TablePlus functionality while maintaining TUI elegance inspired by LazyGit. Expand database support to include PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and Redis. Deliver major feature additions with significant UI/UX improvements to create the definitive "why use GUI when you can use TUI" SQL database management experience.

**Impact Assessment**: ✅ Moderate to Major Impact (substantial existing code changes + architectural enhancements)

### Goals and Background Context

**Goals**:
• Create the definitive terminal-based SQL database management tool that rivals GUI tools like TablePlus
• Establish LazyTables as the "LazyGit for databases" - elegant, powerful, keyboard-driven workflow
• Support multi-database ecosystem (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, Redis) with unified UX

**Background Context**:
The current LazyTables foundation provides solid terminal UI infrastructure and basic PostgreSQL support, but lacks the comprehensive feature set needed to be a true TablePlus alternative. Developers who live in the terminal want database management tools that match their workflow - fast, keyboard-driven, and visually elegant. LazyGit proved that terminal tools can be more efficient than GUI counterparts when designed thoughtfully. This enhancement builds on the existing six-pane architecture to deliver enterprise-grade database management capabilities while maintaining the terminal-native experience that makes LazyTables unique.

**CR4**: Configuration file format must remain backward compatible with existing ~/.lazytables/config.toml structure

**CR5**: All existing keyboard shortcuts and modal behaviors must be preserved while adding database-specific extensions

## User Interface Enhancement Goals

### Integration with Existing UI

The enhanced UI will build upon LazyTables' proven six-pane layout while adding adaptive behaviors:

- **Contextual Pane Modes**: Tables pane adapts to show SQL tables vs Redis keys based on active connection type
- **Enhanced Status Indicators**: Expand existing connection status to show database type, query execution state, and operation progress
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex database-specific features appear only when relevant, maintaining clean interface for simple operations
- **Consistent Visual Language**: All enhancements follow existing vim-style keybinding patterns and terminal-optimized display conventions

### Modified/New Screens and Views

**Enhanced Existing Panes**:
- **Connection Pane**: Add database type icons, connection health indicators, multi-database switching
- **Tables Pane**: Database-adaptive content (SQL tables/views vs Redis keys/namespaces)
- **Details Pane**: Rich metadata display with database-specific information (PostgreSQL extensions, MySQL engines, Redis key types)
- **Query Editor**: Syntax highlighting, query templates, database-specific snippet insertion
- **Results Pane**: Enhanced data type rendering, pagination indicators

**New Modal Interfaces**:
- **Schema Designer**: DDL operation wizards for table/index creation
- **Redis Command Interface**: Dedicated Redis command execution with data type-specific viewers

### UI Consistency Requirements

- **Visual Continuity**: All database-specific features use consistent color coding and iconography
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Database-specific shortcuts extend vim patterns (e.g., `gR` for Redis mode, `gS` for schema operations)
- **Help System Integration**: Existing `?` help expands to include database-specific command references
- **Error Display**: Consistent error presentation across all database types in status bar and contextual messages
- **Loading States**: Unified progress indication for all async database operations

- **Async Runtime Complexity**: Managing multiple database connection pools could create deadlocks
- **Terminal Rendering Limits**: Syntax highlighting may overwhelm terminal capabilities

**Integration Risks**:
- **Redis Paradigm Mismatch**: Key-value operations don't map cleanly to existing SQL-focused UI
- **Database-Specific Features**: PostgreSQL arrays, MySQL JSON, SQLite PRAGMA don't fit unified patterns
- **Connection State Management**: Multiple active databases complicate existing state machine
- **Performance Regression**: Additional database checks could slow existing PostgreSQL operations

**Deployment Risks**:
- **Binary Size Growth**: Adding 4 database drivers could significantly increase executable size
- **Platform Compatibility**: Database native dependencies may complicate cross-platform builds
- **Configuration Migration**: Users may need guidance migrating to enhanced configuration format
- **Feature Discoverability**: Rich feature set may overwhelm users familiar with simple interface

**Mitigation Strategies**:
