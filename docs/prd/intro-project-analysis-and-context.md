# Intro Project Analysis and Context

## Existing Project Overview

**Analysis Source**: IDE-based fresh analysis from existing documentation in docs/dev/ and docs/user/

**Current Project State**:
LazyTables is a terminal-based SQL database viewer and editor built in Rust using Ratatui. It features a fixed six-pane layout optimized for database navigation with vim-style keyboard shortcuts. Currently supports PostgreSQL with planned expansion to MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and others. The application provides connection management, table browsing, SQL query editing with file management, and real-time query results display.

## Available Documentation Analysis

**Available Documentation**: ✅ Complete
- ✅ Tech Stack Documentation (Rust, Ratatui, async database adapters)
- ✅ Source Tree/Architecture (six-pane layout, event system, state management)
- ✅ Coding Standards (Rust best practices, vim consistency)
- ✅ API Documentation (Database adapter pattern, plugin system design)
- ✅ External API Documentation (Database connection protocols)
- ⚠️ UX/UI Guidelines (Partial - vim-style patterns documented)
- ✅ Technical Debt Documentation (Performance targets, security considerations)

## Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**: ✅ New Feature Addition (Major features to be delivered)

**Enhancement Description**: Transform LazyTables into a comprehensive terminal-based SQL tool that rivals TablePlus functionality while maintaining TUI elegance inspired by LazyGit. Expand database support to include PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and Redis. Deliver major feature additions with significant UI/UX improvements to create the definitive "why use GUI when you can use TUI" SQL database management experience.

**Impact Assessment**: ✅ Moderate to Major Impact (substantial existing code changes + architectural enhancements)

## Goals and Background Context

**Goals**:
• Create the definitive terminal-based SQL database management tool that rivals GUI tools like TablePlus
• Establish LazyTables as the "LazyGit for databases" - elegant, powerful, keyboard-driven workflow
• Support multi-database ecosystem (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, Redis) with unified UX

**Background Context**:
The current LazyTables foundation provides solid terminal UI infrastructure and basic PostgreSQL support, but lacks the comprehensive feature set needed to be a true TablePlus alternative. Developers who live in the terminal want database management tools that match their workflow - fast, keyboard-driven, and visually elegant. LazyGit proved that terminal tools can be more efficient than GUI counterparts when designed thoughtfully. This enhancement builds on the existing six-pane architecture to deliver enterprise-grade database management capabilities while maintaining the terminal-native experience that makes LazyTables unique.
