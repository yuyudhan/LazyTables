# Story 1.5: Enhanced Results Display and Export

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer analyzing query results from different databases,
**I want** improved results display with export capabilities,
**so that** I can efficiently view, navigate, and export data regardless of database type with performance suitable for large datasets.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Results pane displays database-specific data types appropriately (MySQL JSON, PostgreSQL arrays)
2. Pagination controls handle large result sets efficiently across database types
3. CSV and JSON export functionality works with streaming for datasets over 1MB
4. Export progress indication appears for operations exceeding 2 seconds
5. Results navigation maintains vim-style shortcuts with enhanced data type rendering

### Integration Verification

- **IV1**: PostgreSQL result display maintains current performance and navigation behavior
- **IV2**: Results pane navigation shortcuts (r, j/k/h/l, gg/G) work identically
- **IV3**: Large dataset handling preserves existing memory usage patterns and scrolling performance

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Story 1.1** provides enhanced Connection trait with execute_raw_query() returning structured QueryResult. **Story 1.4** implements query editor that will execute queries and send results to this results display component. Stories 1.2 and 1.3 provide database context awareness needed for data type rendering.

### Data Models
**Source: architecture/api-specification.md#core-data-structures**
- `QueryResult` struct with columns, rows, affected_rows, execution_time, has_more, total_count fields
- `ColumnInfo` and `Row` types for tabular data representation with database-specific type information
- Support for streaming results via QueryStream for large datasets
- Pagination support built into QueryResult structure

**Source: Current codebase analysis - src/ui/components/table_viewer.rs**
- `TableTab` struct with comprehensive table display functionality
- `ColumnInfo` with name, data_type, is_nullable, is_primary_key, max_display_width
- Existing pagination with current_page, rows_per_page, total_rows
- Virtual scrolling with scroll_offset_x, scroll_offset_y
- Cell editing capabilities with modified_cells tracking

### Component Specifications
**Source: architecture/components.md#ResultsPane**
- Interfaces: `display_query_results()`, `handle_pagination()`
- Dependencies: Query results cache, viewport management
- Technology: Ratatui Table widget with virtual scrolling, custom data formatters
- Integration with database adapters for result streaming

**Source: Current implementation analysis**
- Layout manager provides `tabular_output` area (65% of right side height)
- Existing TableTab component provides foundation for results display
- Query execution system in place from ExecuteQueryCommand

### File Locations
**Source: Current project structure analysis**
- Results display enhancement: `src/ui/components/table_viewer.rs` (existing, needs enhancement)
- Export manager: `src/export/mod.rs` and `src/export/manager.rs` (to be created)
- Layout integration: `src/ui/layout/mod.rs` (existing, provides tabular_output area)
- State management: `src/app/state.rs` (existing, needs export state)
- Database integration: Use QueryResult from enhanced Connection trait

### Technical Constraints
**Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table**
- Use csv 1.3+ and serde_json 1.0+ for export functionality
- Use Ratatui 0.25+ Table widget with virtual scrolling capabilities
- Use Tokio 1.35+ async runtime for streaming export operations
- Use existing SQLx 0.7+ for large dataset streaming from database adapters
- Follow vim-style navigation patterns established in the application

**Database-Specific Data Type Rendering:**
- **MySQL Types**: JSON (syntax highlighted), TIMESTAMP (formatted), DECIMAL (precision preserved), BLOB (hex display)
- **PostgreSQL Types**: JSONB (formatted), ARRAY (bracket notation), INTERVAL (human readable), BYTEA (hex display)
- **Common Types**: NULL (styled), BOOLEAN (true/false), TEXT (truncated with expansion), NUMERIC (aligned)

### Export Requirements
**Source: Epic acceptance criteria and tech stack**
- **CSV Export**: Headers, proper escaping, configurable delimiters, UTF-8 encoding
- **JSON Export**: Array of objects format, proper type preservation, streaming for large datasets
- **Streaming Support**: Process datasets over 1MB in chunks to prevent memory issues
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar, percentage, estimated time remaining, cancellation
- **File Management**: Default naming with timestamp, file selection dialog, export history

### Testing
**Testing Standards:** No specific guidance found in architecture docs

**Testing Requirements for this story:**
- Unit tests for data type rendering with different database types
- Performance tests for virtual scrolling with large datasets (>10K rows)
- Integration tests for export functionality with streaming
- Tests for vim navigation shortcuts and keyboard handling
- Tests for pagination memory management and performance
- Tests for export progress tracking and cancellation

### Project Structure Notes
The existing TableTab component provides excellent foundation for results display:
- Comprehensive table functionality with editing, search, pagination
- Virtual scrolling and memory management capabilities
- Vim-style navigation already implemented
- Cell rendering and formatting system in place

**Enhancement Strategy**: Extend existing TableTab rather than replacing, add export capabilities as separate module, integrate with query execution workflow from Story 1.4.

**No structural conflicts identified** - implementation builds on existing robust table display infrastructure.

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**Based on development notes and current codebase patterns:**

- **Test file location**: Tests alongside source files using Rust's built-in test framework
- **Test standards**: Unit tests for rendering components, integration tests for export operations
- **Testing frameworks**: Rust standard test framework with tokio for async testing, criterion for performance
- **Specific requirements**:
  - Test data type rendering for MySQL vs PostgreSQL specific types
  - Test virtual scrolling performance with datasets over 10K rows
  - Test export streaming functionality with large datasets
  - Test export progress tracking and cancellation mechanisms
  - Test vim navigation shortcuts in results pane
  - Test memory usage patterns during large dataset display
  - Test pagination controls and navigation efficiency
