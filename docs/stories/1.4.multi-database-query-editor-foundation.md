# Story 1.4: Multi-Database Query Editor Foundation

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer writing SQL for different databases,
**I want** enhanced query editor capabilities with database-aware features,
**so that** I can write MySQL and PostgreSQL queries efficiently with appropriate syntax guidance and execution.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Query editor detects active database connection and adjusts syntax validation accordingly
2. Basic keyword highlighting works for MySQL and PostgreSQL syntax differences
3. Query execution (Ctrl+Enter) handles database-specific SQL dialects correctly
4. Error messages provide database-specific SQL syntax guidance
5. Query history maintains database context for executed queries

### Integration Verification

- **IV1**: Existing PostgreSQL query execution workflows continue unchanged
- **IV2**: Current query editor shortcuts (q, i, Ctrl+Enter, Ctrl+S) function identically
- **IV3**: SQL file management preserves existing behavior while adding database context awareness

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Story 1.1** provides enhanced Connection trait with execute_raw_query() and database-specific capabilities. **Story 1.3** implements database-adaptive browsing which will inform query context. Story 1.2 is in progress but provides connection management that this story will leverage.

### Data Models
**Source: architecture/data-models.md#SQLiteSchema**
- `query_history` table in local SQLite with query_text, executed_at, execution_time_ms fields
- Need to enhance with `database_type` column for database context tracking
- `QueryResult` structure from API specification for result display
- Connection configuration provides database type context for syntax highlighting

**Source: architecture/api-specification.md#core-data-structures**
- `QueryResult` struct with columns, rows, affected_rows, execution_time, pagination support
- Database-specific error types for enhanced error messaging
- `DatabaseFeature` enum for syntax highlighting feature detection

### Component Specifications
**Source: architecture/components.md#QueryEditor**
- Interfaces: `handle_text_input()`, `execute_query_at_cursor()`, `apply_syntax_highlighting()`
- Dependencies: File manager for SQL files, database adapters for execution
- Technology: Custom text buffer with vim motions, syntect for highlighting
- Integration with StateManager for application-wide query editor state

**Source: Current project structure analysis**
- Layout manager provides `query_window` area for editor placement
- Existing ExecuteQueryCommand in src/commands/query.rs provides foundation
- Six-pane layout allocates dedicated space for query editing interface

### File Locations
**Source: Current project structure and architecture**
- Query editor component: `src/ui/components/query_editor.rs` (to be created)
- Query execution command: `src/commands/query.rs` (existing, needs enhancement)
- Layout management: `src/ui/layout/mod.rs` (existing, provides query_window area)
- State management: `src/app/state.rs` and `src/state/ui.rs` (existing)
- Database integration: Use enhanced Connection trait from `src/database/connection.rs`

### Technical Constraints
**Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table**
- Use syntect 5.0+ for SQL syntax highlighting in terminal
- Use Ratatui 0.25+ TUI framework for text widget and editor rendering
- Use existing SQLx 0.7+ for query execution through database adapters
- Use Tokio 1.35+ async runtime for non-blocking query execution
- Follow vim-style navigation patterns established in the application

**Current Implementation Context:**
- Query window area already allocated in layout manager (35% of right side height)
- Command system exists with ExecuteQueryCommand providing basic query execution
- Database adapters from story 1.1 provide execute_raw_query() interface
- File management system exists for SQL file loading and saving

### Syntax Highlighting Requirements
**Source: architecture/tech-stack.md + epic requirements**
- MySQL-specific keywords: ENGINE, AUTO_INCREMENT, UNSIGNED, ZEROFILL, CHARACTER SET, COLLATE
- PostgreSQL-specific keywords: SERIAL, BIGSERIAL, JSONB, ARRAY, SCHEMA, RETURNS, LANGUAGE
- Common SQL keywords: SELECT, FROM, WHERE, JOIN, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, DROP
- Database functions: MySQL (CONCAT, SUBSTRING, DATE_FORMAT) vs PostgreSQL (STRING_AGG, EXTRACT, GENERATE_SERIES)
- Operator differences: MySQL (REGEXP) vs PostgreSQL (SIMILAR TO, ~, !~)

### Testing
**Testing Standards:** No specific guidance found in architecture docs

**Testing Requirements for this story:**
- Unit tests for syntax highlighting with different database types
- Tests for query execution using tokio-test async framework
- Integration tests for editor-to-database workflow
- Performance tests for syntax highlighting on large SQL files
- Tests for query history storage and retrieval with database context

### Project Structure Notes
The existing project structure supports query editor implementation:
- Layout manager provides dedicated query_window area
- Command system provides foundation for query execution
- Database adapters provide unified interface for query execution
- State management system can accommodate query editor state

**No structural conflicts identified** - implementation can leverage existing patterns and infrastructure.

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**Based on development notes and current codebase patterns:**

- **Test file location**: Tests alongside source files using Rust's built-in test framework
- **Test standards**: Unit tests for component rendering, integration tests for database operations
- **Testing frameworks**: Rust standard test framework with tokio for async testing, ratatui testing utilities
- **Specific requirements**:
  - Test syntax highlighting for MySQL vs PostgreSQL keywords
  - Test query execution with different database adapters
  - Test query history storage and retrieval functionality
  - Test vim-style editor navigation and text manipulation
  - Test database context switching and syntax validation
  - Test error handling for malformed queries and connection failures
