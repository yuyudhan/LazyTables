# Epic and Story Structure

## Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: **Three Sequential Epics with Dependencies** - Epic 1 (MySQL/MariaDB + UI Foundation), Epic 2 (SQLite + Advanced UI Features), Epic 3 (Redis + Complete Integration)

**Rationale**: This structure builds complexity incrementally while delivering value at each milestone. MySQL/MariaDB are similar enough to PostgreSQL to validate the adapter expansion approach. SQLite introduces file-based database patterns. Redis requires the most significant UI paradigm additions and benefits from proven UI foundation.
