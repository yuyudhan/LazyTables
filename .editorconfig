# File: src/.editorconfig

# Purpose: This file enforces consistent coding styles across the LazyTables project.
# It defines formatting rules for Go source files and configuration files to ensure
# readability, maintainability, and compatibility with tools like Neovim.
#
# Key Functionalities:
# - Sets UTF-8 encoding and Unix-style line endings for all files.
# - Specifies 4-space indentation for Go files, aligning with developer preference.
# - Uses 2-space indentation for JSON/YAML configs for compactness.
#
# Maintenance Tips:
# - Update indent_size if team preferences change, but keep consistent across files.
# - Add new file patterns (e.g., [*.md]) as the project expands to include docs.

# Top-most EditorConfig file to prevent overrides from parent directories
root = true

# Default settings applied to all files for consistency and reliability

charset = utf-8             # Enforces UTF-8 encoding for compatibility and emoji support
end_of_line = lf            # Uses Unix-style line endings for cross-platform consistency
insert_final_newline = true # Ensures POSIX compliance and clean diffs
trim_trailing_whitespace = true # Removes unnecessary whitespace for cleaner files

# Go-specific formatting for source code
[*.go]
indent_style = space        # Uses spaces over tabs for precise control in Neovim
indent_size = 4             # Sets 4-space indentation per CTO preference

# Formatting for configuration files (e.g., JSON, YAML)
[*.{json,yaml,yml}]
indent_style = space        # Uses spaces for standard config file formatting
indent_size = 2             # Keeps configs compact and readable
