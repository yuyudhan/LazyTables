## Tips for New Users

### Getting Started
1. **Start with the help system** - Press `?` in any pane for context-specific help
2. **Practice navigation** - Use `Tab` and `Ctrl+h/j/k/l` to move between panes
3. **Learn the modes** - Normal mode for navigation, Insert mode for editing
4. **Use the built-in help** - Every pane has detailed guidance

### Productivity Tips
- **Query at cursor**: Place cursor on any SQL statement and press `Ctrl+Enter`
- **Save frequently used queries**: Use `Ctrl+S` to save queries to files
- **Search everything**: Most panes support `/` for searching
- **Use vim motions**: `gg`, `G`, `0`, `$`, `w`, `b` work throughout the app
- **Tab management**: Work with multiple tables using `S`/`D` to switch tabs

### Common Workflows
1. **Database exploration**: Connect ‚Üí Browse tables ‚Üí View details ‚Üí Query data
2. **Query development**: Write in editor ‚Üí Execute with `Ctrl+Enter` ‚Üí Save with `Ctrl+S`
3. **Data editing**: Open table ‚Üí Navigate with `h/j/k/l` ‚Üí Edit with `i` ‚Üí Save with `Enter`
4. **File management**: Browse SQL files ‚Üí Load with `Enter` ‚Üí Edit ‚Üí Save

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Check connection credentials and host/port
- Verify database is running and accessible
- Look at status indicators for specific error messages
- Use debug mode (`Ctrl+B`) for detailed connection logs

### Performance
- LazyTables is optimized for large datasets with virtual scrolling
- Query results are paginated automatically for >10K rows
- Use filters and search to work with large tables efficiently

### Keyboard Navigation
- Remember that text input requires `i` to enter insert mode
- Press `ESC` to return to normal mode from any input state
- Use `?` in any pane for context-specific help
- Arrow keys work for dropdown navigation, `h/j/k/l` for vim-style movement
