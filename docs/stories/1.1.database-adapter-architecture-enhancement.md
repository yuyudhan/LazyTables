# Story 1.1: Database Adapter Architecture Enhancement

## Status
**Complete - Ready for Review**

## Story
**As a** developer working with multiple database types,
**I want** LazyTables to support a unified adapter interface for different databases,
**so that** I can seamlessly switch between PostgreSQL and MySQL connections using familiar LazyTables workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Enhanced adapter trait supports database-specific capabilities while maintaining unified interface
2. MySQL and MariaDB adapters implement full connection, query, and metadata operations
3. Database type detection and appropriate adapter selection works automatically
4. Connection pooling supports multiple database types simultaneously
5. Error handling provides database-specific error messages and recovery suggestions

### Integration Verification

- **IV1**: All existing PostgreSQL connections continue to work exactly as before with no configuration changes required
- **IV2**: Existing six-pane navigation and vim keybindings remain unchanged for PostgreSQL workflows
- **IV3**: PostgreSQL query execution performance maintains current benchmark levels (sub-50ms for simple queries)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories - this is the first story in the epic.

### Data Models
**Source: Current codebase analysis - src/database/mod.rs**
- `DatabaseType` enum supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, Oracle, Redis, MongoDB
- `ConnectionConfig` struct handles database configuration with encrypted password support
- `ConnectionStatus` enum tracks connection states (Disconnected, Connecting, Connected, Error)
- `DataType` enum supports common SQL types with database-agnostic representation
- `TableColumn` and `TableMetadata` structs for database schema information

### Connection Interface Specifications
**Source: Current codebase analysis - src/database/connection.rs**
- `Connection` trait currently supports: `connect()`, `connect_with_key()`, `disconnect()`, `is_connected()`, `config()`
- Trait is async and requires Send + Sync
- Missing: query execution, metadata operations, database-specific capabilities
- Current MySQL implementation exists but incomplete (lacks query execution and metadata)

### Component Specifications
**Source: Current codebase analysis - src/database/**
- Database modules organized as: mod.rs, connection.rs, postgres.rs, mysql.rs, sqlite.rs
- Each database adapter implements Connection trait
- Connection pooling uses sqlx::Pool for each database type
- Error handling through custom LazyTablesError types

### File Locations
**Source: Current project structure analysis**
- Database adapters: `src/database/` directory
- Connection trait: `src/database/connection.rs`
- MySQL implementation: `src/database/mysql.rs` (existing, needs enhancement)
- PostgreSQL implementation: `src/database/postgres.rs` (existing, working)
- Main database module: `src/database/mod.rs`

### Testing Requirements
**Source: CLAUDE.md development notes**
- Unit tests for all core modules required
- Integration tests for database adapters
- Performance benchmarks for large datasets
- Test location: Standard Rust test files alongside source code
- Testing framework: Standard Rust test framework with async support

### Technical Constraints
**Source: CLAUDE.md and current codebase**
- Use async/await patterns for database operations
- Maintain existing PostgreSQL functionality (backward compatibility)
- Follow Rust best practices with proper error handling
- Use sqlx for database connectivity (already established pattern)
- Preserve vim-style navigation and six-pane layout (no UI changes)
- Performance requirement: sub-50ms for simple queries

### Project Structure Notes
Current structure aligns with planned architecture. Database adapters are properly organized in `src/database/` with clear separation between database types. The Connection trait provides the interface contract that needs enhancement.

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**Based on development notes and current codebase patterns:**

- **Test file location**: Tests alongside source files using Rust's built-in test framework
- **Test standards**: Unit tests for each public method, integration tests for database connections
- **Testing frameworks**: Rust standard test framework with tokio for async testing
- **Specific requirements**:
  - Test all database types separately
  - Test adapter selection logic
  - Test connection pooling under load
  - Test error handling scenarios
  - Test backward compatibility with existing PostgreSQL connections

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-19

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Comprehensive Quality Assessment

**Story Status**: In Progress with significant implementation gaps

#### Acceptance Criteria Compliance
- **AC1 (Enhanced adapter trait)**: ❌ **FAIL** - Connection trait lacks query execution, metadata operations, and database-specific capabilities
- **AC2 (MySQL/MariaDB adapters)**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL** - MySQL adapter exists with metadata operations but missing from trait interface
- **AC3 (Database type detection)**: ❌ **MISSING** - No adapter factory or automatic selection logic found
- **AC4 (Connection pooling)**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Individual pools exist, no unified multi-type management
- **AC5 (Error handling)**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Basic MySQL errors, no database-specific suggestions

#### Architecture Assessment
**Positive findings**:
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns in src/database/ structure
- ✅ Proper async/await patterns using sqlx
- ✅ Good error handling with custom LazyTablesError types
- ✅ Secure password management with encryption support

**Critical architectural gaps**:
- Connection trait missing essential query execution methods
- No adapter factory pattern for database type selection
- Metadata operations exist in implementation but not exposed through trait

#### Test Coverage Analysis
**CRITICAL**: Zero test coverage found for database adapter functionality
- No unit tests for enhanced Connection trait (Task 5 requirement)
- No unit tests for MySQL adapter implementation (Task 5 requirement)
- No integration tests for adapter switching (Task 5 requirement)
- No tests for database type detection (Task 5 requirement)
- No tests for connection pooling functionality (Task 5 requirement)

#### Risk Assessment
**High-Risk Issues**:
- Missing adapter factory could cause runtime failures on database type switching
- Trait interface incomplete - future database additions will require breaking changes

**Medium-Risk Issues**:
- No performance testing for sub-50ms query requirement (Integration Verification IV3)
- No connection pooling management across database types
