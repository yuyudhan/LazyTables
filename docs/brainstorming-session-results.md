**Participant:** Project Owner

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** LazyTables Feature Set Enhancement and Refinement

**Session Goals:** Broad exploration of feature possibilities followed by focused refinement of core functionality, specifically building on existing PRD features while maintaining TUI focus and performance

**Techniques Used:** What If Scenarios (3 iterations), SCAMPER Method (complete), Mind Mapping (focused on Table Browser + Details)

**Total Ideas Generated:** 15 core concepts explored

**Key Themes Identified:**
- Simplicity over complexity - focus on core database functionality
- Performance preservation while adding features
- TUI-native design patterns (no complex visualizations)
- Enhanced existing workflows rather than new paradigms

## Technique Sessions

### What If Scenarios - 15 minutes
**Description:** Explored provocative questions about LazyTables capabilities to discover unexpected possibilities

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Cross-database data relationship visualization (rejected - not TUI-appropriate)
2. Predictive navigation based on user patterns (rejected - unnecessary complexity)
3. Integrated database maintenance operations (rejected - too complex)

**Insights Discovered:**
- User strongly prefers focused, essential functionality over feature expansion
- TUI constraints are viewed positively as design boundaries
- Complexity for complexity's sake should be avoided

**Notable Connections:**
- All "what if" scenarios led back to core database viewing/editing needs
- User has clear vision of tool boundaries and purpose

### SCAMPER Method - 25 minutes
**Description:** Systematic examination of existing PRD features using Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, Reverse

**Ideas Generated:**
1. **Substitute:** Temporary pane substitution for specific tasks (accepted concept)
2. **Combine:** Table browser + details pane integration (selected for deep exploration)
3. **Combine:** Query editor + results split-screen (rejected - prefer separate panes)
4. **Adapt:** Vim buffer management for SQL files (accepted)
5. **Adapt:** LazyGit staging concepts (rejected)
6. **Modify:** Query execution under cursor only (accepted)
7. **Modify:** Enhanced table navigation patterns (refined to standard j/k + Enter)
8. **Modify:** Connection quick-switching (rejected - prefer pane navigation)
9. **Put to other uses:** SQL file browser for other content (rejected - stay focused)
10. **Eliminate:** Export functionality (eliminated - CSV/JSON not needed)
11. **Eliminate:** Encrypted credential storage (simplified to basic config)
12. **Reverse:** Query-first vs table-first workflow (clarified - both equally important)

**Insights Discovered:**
- Strong preference for maintaining separate, clean panes
- Elimination of export features reduces scope significantly
- Simplified connection management reduces complexity
- Query-under-cursor execution is highly desired

**Notable Connections:**
- All successful ideas enhanced existing workflows rather than replacing them
- Performance and simplicity consistently trumped feature richness

### Mind Mapping: Table Browser + Details - 10 minutes
**Description:** Deep exploration of horizontal split layout integration for combined table browsing and metadata display

**Ideas Generated:**
1. **Toggle Mode:** Single pane switching between list/detail views
2. **Horizontal Split:** 60/40 split with live details (selected)
3. **Vertical Expansion:** Inline expandable table details

**Insights Discovered:**
- Horizontal split provides optimal information density
- Fixed ratios preferred over responsive layouts
- Indexes and constraints are priority metadata

**Notable Connections:**
- Layout choice affects navigation patterns significantly
- Information hierarchy drives interface design decisions
