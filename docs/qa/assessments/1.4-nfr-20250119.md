# NFR Assessment: 1.4

Date: 2025-01-19
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS - Database connection security implemented via SQLx
- Performance: CONCERNS - Syntax highlighting latency unknown for large SQL files
- Compatibility: PASS - SQLx provides cross-database compatibility
- Usability: PASS - Vim-style navigation with syntax highlighting enhances UX
- Reliability: PASS - Proper error handling and database validation implemented
- Maintainability: PASS - Comprehensive unit tests and clean architecture
- Portability: CONCERNS - Limited to Unix platforms (no Windows)
- Functional Suitability: PASS - All acceptance criteria implemented

## Critical Issues

1. **Syntax highlighting performance** (Performance)
   - Risk: Large SQL files (>1MB) may cause UI lag
   - Fix: Add lazy rendering or file size limits for syntect

2. **Platform portability** (Portability)
   - Risk: Windows users cannot use the application
   - Fix: Consider Windows terminal support in future releases

## Quick Wins

- Add performance metrics for syntax highlighting: ~2 hours
- Implement file size warnings for large SQL files: ~1 hour
- Add async syntax highlighting for better responsiveness: ~4 hours

## Evidence Found

### Security
✅ SQLx handles parameterized queries and connection security
✅ No hardcoded credentials in codebase
✅ Database validation prevents SQL injection

### Performance
⚠️ No performance benchmarks for syntax highlighting
✅ Async query execution prevents UI blocking
✅ Database connection pooling via SQLx

### Reliability
✅ Comprehensive error handling in query execution
✅ Database-specific error messages implemented
✅ Query history persistence with SQLite

### Maintainability
✅ Unit tests covering all major components
✅ Clear separation of concerns in architecture
✅ Documented dependencies and integration points

### Usability
✅ Vim-style navigation consistency
✅ Database-aware syntax highlighting
✅ Context-sensitive error messages

### Compatibility
✅ MySQL and PostgreSQL dialect support
✅ SQLx provides database abstraction layer
✅ Cross-platform terminal support via crossterm

### Portability
⚠️ No Windows support (design constraint)
✅ Linux and macOS compatibility verified
✅ Standard Rust dependencies

### Functional Suitability
✅ All acceptance criteria implemented
✅ Database-aware query execution
✅ Query history with context preservation
