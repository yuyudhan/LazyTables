<!--FilePath: docs/rough.md-->

We need to have support for mouse based interactions.
We'll have to support some most famous sql databases.

Support for theming
- There should be a couple of themes avaialable in the system
- Allow the extenders to create new themes.
- external themes should be easily configurable.

This tool should be pluggable meaning we should have option to allow others to create plugin and specify plugins.
We should allow creation and installations of the plugins by people in method similar to what Tmux does.

The tool should also respect the ~/.config/LazyTables directory in order to allow the users to configure the tool for themselves.

Overall we want the best experience taking inspiration from tmux and neovim.

Can evaluate if using fzf can be helpful to fuzzy find something, or should use database query
