# Epic 3: Redis Integration + Complete Feature Set

**Epic Type**: Brownfield Enhancement
**Epic Status**: Planned
**Dependencies**: Epic 1 (Multi-Database Foundation), Epic 2 (SQLite + Advanced TUI)
**Target Completion**: Q2 2025

## Epic Goal

Complete LazyTables' transformation into a comprehensive multi-database terminal tool by adding Redis key-value support with specialized UI paradigms and delivering the final feature set that establishes LazyTables as the definitive "LazyGit for databases."

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

- **Current relevant functionality**: Multi-database support for PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite with advanced TUI features and syntax highlighting
- **Technology stack**: Rust + Ratatui + SQLx + redis-rs + enhanced query editor with syntax highlighting
- **Integration points**: DatabaseAdapter trait, unified connection management, six-pane TUI with file browser support

### Enhancement Details

- **What's being added/changed**: Redis key-value database support with specialized pane modes + cross-database query comparison + comprehensive schema management operations
- **How it integrates**: Redis adapter with key-value specific UI modes that activate when Redis connection is selected, while maintaining SQL database workflows for other connection types
- **Success criteria**: Redis keys/values browse intuitively, cross-database context switching works seamlessly, schema management operations (DDL) work safely across all database types

## Stories

### Story 3.1: Redis Key-Value Database Integration
Add Redis adapter with specialized key browser interface that transforms the tables pane into a key namespace browser and details pane into value viewer with data type-specific formatting.

**Key Features**:
- Redis connection support with AUTH and SSL
- Key namespace browser with pattern filtering
- Value viewer with data type detection (string, hash, list, set, zset)
- Redis command execution interface
- Key expiration and TTL management

### Story 3.2: Cross-Database Context Switching
Implement seamless switching between active database connections while maintaining query editor state, enabling developers to compare queries and results across different databases simultaneously.

**Key Features**:
- Multiple concurrent database connections
- Query editor state preservation during connection switching
- Side-by-side result comparison
- Connection-specific query history
- Performance monitoring across connections

### Story 3.3: Schema Management Operations (DDL)
Add safe schema management capabilities (CREATE/ALTER/DROP operations) with confirmation dialogs and rollback support, working across PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite with database-appropriate operations.

**Key Features**:
- Table/index creation wizards
- Schema modification operations
- Safety confirmations with preview
- Transaction rollback support
- Database-specific DDL generation

## Compatibility Requirements

- ✅ All existing SQL database functionality (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite) remains unchanged
- ✅ Six-pane layout adapts contextually - SQL mode for SQL databases, key-value mode for Redis
- ✅ Vim navigation and keybinding patterns preserved across all database types
- ✅ Performance targets maintained across all database connection types

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk**: Redis paradigm mismatch - key-value operations don't map cleanly to SQL-focused six-pane UI
- **Mitigation**: Contextual pane transformation - tables pane becomes key browser, details pane becomes value viewer when Redis connection is active
- **Rollback Plan**: Feature flags allow disabling Redis support and schema operations, reverting to Epic 2 functionality

## Definition of Done

- ✅ All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- ✅ Existing PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite functionality verified through comprehensive regression testing
- ✅ Redis connection displays keys in intuitive browser interface with namespace support
- ✅ Cross-database switching maintains query context and performance
- ✅ Schema management operations work safely with appropriate confirmations and rollbacks
- ✅ Complete feature parity with TablePlus-equivalent functionality achieved
- ✅ Performance benchmarks maintained across all five supported database types

## Strategic Impact Analysis

### Value Delivery
- **Complete Vision Achievement**: Fulfills the "LazyGit for databases" vision with comprehensive multi-database support
- **Market Differentiation**: First terminal tool to seamlessly handle both SQL and NoSQL paradigms in unified interface
- **Enterprise Ready**: Schema management capabilities make LazyTables suitable for production database administration

### Complexity Assessment
- **High Complexity**: Redis paradigm requires significant UI adaptation
- **Medium Risk**: Schema operations could accidentally damage production data
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Contextual UI modes, extensive safety confirmations, comprehensive testing

### Dependencies
- Epic 1 completion (multi-database foundation)
- Epic 2 completion (SQLite + advanced TUI features)
- Architecture patterns proven and stable
- Performance baseline maintained

## Integration Requirements

- Preserve all existing SQL database functionality while adding Redis key-value paradigm
- Establish contextual UI modes that transform interface based on database type
- Create foundation for schema management operations across all database types
- Implement cross-database context switching capabilities

## Epic Progression Summary

- **Epic 1**: Foundation (PostgreSQL + MySQL/MariaDB + UI framework)
- **Epic 2**: Expansion (SQLite + advanced features)
- **Epic 3**: Completion (Redis + final feature set)

This progression strategically builds complexity:
1. **Similar Paradigms First**: MySQL/MariaDB are similar to existing PostgreSQL
2. **File-Based Complexity**: SQLite introduces file operations
3. **Paradigm Shift**: Redis requires the most significant UI adaptations
