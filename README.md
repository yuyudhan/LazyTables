- **Arrow keys are used for dropdown/list navigation**
- **Visual feedback shows when in insert mode (e.g., "[INSERT]" indicator)**

This applies to:
- Connection creation/editing forms
- Table creation forms
- Query editing windows
- File renaming operations
- All text input fields

## Status Indicators

### Connection Status
- `✓` Connected to database
- `—` Not connected
- `✗` Connection failed
- `⟳` Connecting in progress

### Display Format
Connections show as: `[Icon] [Status] Name (type) [DB: name] Status`

Database type icons:
- `🐘` PostgreSQL
- `🐬` MySQL
- `📁` SQLite

## Configuration

LazyTables stores its configuration and data in the following locations:

### Configuration Directory
```
~/.config/lazytables/
└── config.toml       # Main configuration file
```

### Data Directory
```
~/.lazytables/
├── README.md         # Data directory documentation
├── connections.json  # Database connection definitions (encrypted)
├── connections/      # Individual connection files
├── sql_files/        # Saved SQL query files
│   └── sample_queries.sql  # Sample SQL queries
├── logs/             # Application log files
│   └── lazytables.log
└── backups/          # Backup files
```

### Connection Storage
- **Secure encryption** for database credentials
- **Connection files** stored individually for better organization
- **Auto-backup** of connection configurations
- **Legacy support** for existing connection formats

## Tips for New Users

### Getting Started
1. **Start with the help system** - Press `?` in any pane for context-specific help
2. **Practice navigation** - Use `Tab` and `Ctrl+h/j/k/l` to move between panes
3. **Learn the modes** - Normal mode for navigation, Insert mode for editing
4. **Use the built-in help** - Every pane has detailed guidance

### Productivity Tips
- **Query at cursor**: Place cursor on any SQL statement and press `Ctrl+Enter`
- **Save frequently used queries**: Use `Ctrl+S` to save queries to files
- **Search everything**: Most panes support `/` for searching
- **Use vim motions**: `gg`, `G`, `0`, `$`, `w`, `b` work throughout the app
- **Tab management**: Work with multiple tables using `S`/`D` to switch tabs

### Common Workflows
1. **Database exploration**: Connect → Browse tables → View details → Query data
2. **Query development**: Write in editor → Execute with `Ctrl+Enter` → Save with `Ctrl+S`
3. **Data editing**: Open table → Navigate with `h/j/k/l` → Edit with `i` → Save with `Enter`
4. **File management**: Browse SQL files → Load with `Enter` → Edit → Save

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Check connection credentials and host/port
- Verify database is running and accessible
- Look at status indicators for specific error messages
- Use debug mode (`Ctrl+B`) for detailed connection logs

### Performance
- LazyTables is optimized for large datasets with virtual scrolling
- Query results are paginated automatically for >10K rows
- Use filters and search to work with large tables efficiently

### Keyboard Navigation
- Remember that text input requires `i` to enter insert mode
- Press `ESC` to return to normal mode from any input state
- Use `?` in any pane for context-specific help
- Arrow keys work for dropdown navigation, `h/j/k/l` for vim-style movement
