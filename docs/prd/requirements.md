# Requirements

## Functional

**FR1**: LazyTables shall expand database adapter system to support PostgreSQL (enhanced), MySQL, MariaDB, and SQLite using phased rollout approach while maintaining existing connection management patterns

**FR2**: The six-pane UI architecture shall support database-specific operations with adaptive pane modes while preserving vim-style navigation consistency

**FR3**: Query editor shall support database-specific syntax validation and optimized keyword highlighting within terminal performance constraints

**FR4**: Connection management shall support database-specific authentication methods with unified credential storage for SQL databases

**FR5**: Table browsing shall display database-appropriate metadata (indexes, constraints, triggers, pragmas) with database-specific detail levels

**FR6**: Query results shall support CSV/JSON export up to 10MB with streaming capabilities and pagination for datasets up to 100,000 rows

**FR7**: SQL file management shall support database-specific query templates, snippets, and dialect-aware syntax checking

**FR8**: Redis integration shall provide dedicated key-value interface with specialized panes (key browser, command interface, data type viewers) that activate for Redis connections

**FR9**: Schema management operations shall support database-specific DDL operations (CREATE/ALTER/DROP) with safety confirmations

**FR10**: Cross-database query comparison shall enable switching database contexts while maintaining query editor state

## Non Functional

**NFR1**: Application startup time shall remain under 150ms with up to 3 database drivers loaded (revised from 100ms for realistic multi-DB support)

**NFR2**: UI responsiveness shall maintain 60fps scrolling performance with datasets up to 10,000 rows per pane

**NFR3**: Memory usage shall not exceed 75MB base + 15MB per active database connection (revised for multi-DB reality)

**NFR4**: All database operations shall be async and non-blocking with connection pooling per database type

**NFR5**: Vim-style keyboard navigation shall be consistent with database-specific extensions clearly documented

**NFR6**: Terminal compatibility shall support major terminal emulators with graceful degradation for limited color support

**NFR7**: Database driver loading shall be lazy and modular to minimize resource usage for unused database types

## Compatibility Requirements

**CR1**: Existing PostgreSQL connections and configurations must remain fully functional without any migration required

**CR2**: Current six-pane layout navigation patterns (Ctrl+h/j/k/l, focus shortcuts c/t/d/r/q/s) must be preserved exactly

**CR3**: Existing SQL file management, vim keybindings, and query execution (Ctrl+Enter) must continue unchanged

**CR4**: Configuration file format must remain backward compatible with existing ~/.lazytables/config.toml structure

**CR5**: All existing keyboard shortcuts and modal behaviors must be preserved while adding database-specific extensions
