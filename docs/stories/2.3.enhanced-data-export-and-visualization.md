# Story 2.3: Enhanced Data Export and Visualization

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** data analyst working with large datasets across different database types,
**I want** advanced data export capabilities with multiple formats and improved data visualization,
**so that** I can efficiently export and analyze data from PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite databases with appropriate formatting for each data type.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Multiple export formats (CSV, JSON, SQL INSERT statements) with database-specific optimization
2. Streaming export for large datasets (>10MB) with progress indicators and cancellation
3. Data type-specific rendering with JSON pretty-print, binary data display, and database-specific formatting
4. Export configuration options (headers, delimiters, formatting preferences) with presets
5. Enhanced data visualization with improved data type rendering and large dataset handling

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Story 1.5 Foundation**: Implemented basic enhanced results display and export with CSV/JSON support and streaming for >1MB datasets. Story 2.3 builds on this foundation with advanced features, larger dataset support (>10MB), and additional export formats.

**Epic 2 Integration**: Story 2.1 adds SQLite file-based support requiring SQLite-specific export optimization. Story 2.2 provides syntax highlighting that enhances SQL INSERT export preview and validation.

**Key Enhancements over Story 1.5**:
- SQL INSERT export format addition
- Larger dataset support (>10MB vs >1MB)
- Advanced data type visualization
- Export configuration and presets
- Database-specific export optimization

### Data Models
**Source: Story 1.5 foundation + Epic 2 enhancements**
- Existing TableTab component with pagination and export capabilities
- ExportManager component from Story 1.5 to be enhanced with additional formats
- Export configuration structures for presets and advanced options
- Progress tracking models for large dataset operations

**Source: Epic 2 database support**
- SQLite-specific export considerations (file-based databases, PRAGMA commands)
- Database-specific data type support from enhanced Connection trait
- Integration with syntax highlighting context from Story 2.2

### Component Specifications
**Source: Story 1.5 + Epic 2 requirements**
- Enhanced ExportManager with SQL INSERT format and advanced streaming
- Export configuration modal with preset management
- Advanced data type renderers with database-specific formatting
- Progress tracking component with pause/resume capabilities

**Current Implementation Context:**
- Story 1.5 provides export foundation that needs enhancement
- Epic 2 database support (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) requires format optimization
- Syntax highlighting from Story 2.2 can enhance SQL export preview

### File Locations
**Source: Story 1.5 implementation + Epic 2 structure**
- Export manager enhancement: `src/export/manager.rs` (from Story 1.5)
- Export formats: `src/export/formats/` (SQL INSERT format to be added)
- Data visualization: `src/ui/components/data_renderer.rs` (enhanced from Story 1.5)
- Export configuration: `src/export/config.rs` (new for presets and advanced options)
- Integration components: Leverage existing Epic 2 foundation

### Technical Constraints
**Source: Epic 2 tech stack + Story 1.5 foundation**
- Use existing csv + serde_json from tech stack, add SQL generation capabilities
- Enhance existing streaming export from Story 1.5 for larger datasets
- Use database adapter capabilities for export optimization
- Maintain async/await patterns for non-blocking large dataset processing
- Follow Epic 2 database-specific optimization patterns

**Advanced Export Requirements:**
- **SQL INSERT Format**: Generate INSERT statements with proper escaping and batch sizing
- **Database Optimization**: PostgreSQL COPY, MySQL LOAD DATA INFILE compatibility
- **Large Dataset Handling**: >10MB streaming with memory management and progress tracking
- **Data Type Rendering**: Advanced visualization for complex types (JSON, arrays, binary)
- **Export Configuration**: Presets, templates, and advanced formatting options

### Integration with Epic 2 Stories
**Story 2.1 Integration**: SQLite file-based exports with database file context
**Story 2.2 Integration**: Syntax highlighting for SQL INSERT export preview and validation
**Database Adapter Integration**: Use enhanced Connection trait capabilities for export optimization

### Testing
**Testing Standards:** Based on Story 1.5 patterns and Epic 2 requirements

**Testing Requirements for this story:**
- Unit tests for SQL INSERT export generation with proper escaping
- Performance tests for streaming export with datasets >10MB
- Tests for advanced data type visualization and rendering
- Integration tests for export configuration and preset management
- Tests for database-specific export optimization
- Memory usage tests for large dataset processing
- Tests for export verification and integrity checking

### Project Structure Notes
Story 1.5 provides excellent foundation for export functionality that can be enhanced for Epic 2 requirements:
- Existing export infrastructure with CSV/JSON support
- Streaming export capabilities for datasets >1MB
- Progress tracking and user experience patterns
- Integration with results display and table components

**Enhancement Strategy**: Build on Story 1.5 export foundation rather than replacing, add Epic 2 advanced features (SQL INSERT, >10MB support, database optimization), integrate with Epic 2 database support and syntax highlighting.

**No structural conflicts identified** - implementation enhances proven Story 1.5 foundation with Epic 2 advanced features.

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**Based on Story 1.5 foundation and Epic 2 patterns:**

- **Test file location**: Tests alongside source files using Rust's built-in test framework
- **Test standards**: Unit tests for export functionality, performance tests for large datasets
- **Testing frameworks**: Rust standard test framework with tokio for async operations, criterion for performance
- **Specific requirements**:
  - Test SQL INSERT export generation with complex data types
  - Test streaming export performance with datasets >10MB
  - Test advanced data type visualization accuracy
  - Test export configuration and preset functionality
